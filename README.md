# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project is a structural mockup of the homepage for a bird watching website. It was created
using HTML and CSS, with the CSS being the driver behind the structure. The structure includes a 
header that spans the full width of the site, which includes text, the logo, and the navigation 
menu. Which is then followed by a 'main content' section that contains two columns (a 'Welcome' 
section, and a sidebar with images), which is then followed by a footer.

## Running/Compiling
First, fork or clone this repository to a new local directory on your computer. Then you can 
either `open the project in VSCode`, and `view it using the LivePreview extension`, or (from your
terminal application) navigate into the `assets` folder and run the following command: 
`open ./index.html`.
